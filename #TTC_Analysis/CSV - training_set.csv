So glad that the # TTC has closed so many entrances in 2017 in order to complete their Presto installation. It's just a shame that it coincides with the decline of this system as all other transit systems using this technology are moving on to the next one.;1
Please # DontDrinkAndDrive tonight friends! If you're in # Toronto you can ride the # TTC for FREE from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. thanks to @ CorbySW! Happy New Year! Be safe and have fun! # CorbySafeRidespic.twitter.com/eF6D4JEBEm;1

How is it possible that after years of planning, scores of people working on it, and $500K spent, only now has # TTC figured out that crowd-sourced content would obviously lead to abuse?

Driving is usually 1/2 or 1/3 the length of a # TTC trip. It sucks, but taking the subway/streetcar/bus is affordable, and the trip can be part of a memorable journey ( # GreatThingsThatHappenedOnTransit).

I take the 44 north to Kipling Station because the 501 wait was 20 minutes. The train went 1 stop and turned around at Kipling. Shuttle bus line up went from the 37 bus platform to the subway train platform. Now I'm on the 110 going back to Lakeshore to take the 501. # TTC eh?;0

After waiting 12 minutes for a train on line 1 going south I am now thrown off a train at Christy station because the train is going out of service... Fix your fucking system. # TTC # ttcfail;0
No but you have no problem condoning a transit system by charges are some of the highest transit fares in North America but yet does not offer a service that warrants those charges... You want to help fix the fucking system... # ttcfail # TTC;0

If your take away here is concern around my calling the streetcar a bus, you're missing the plot. Does the # TTC hire you to troll unhappy customers? Don't bother to reply, the question is rhetorical.;0
It's always nice to hear heated arguments at night on the TTC in scarberia... especially when racial and homophobic slurs are tossed around and the bus driver threatens to put the bus out of service rather than just kicking the person off # 24gonewild # TTC;0

Thank you for not stopping to pick me up, # ttc bus. :(;0
Second of all I wanna say thank you to # ttc for givin me this damn $$$ ticket on top of my student debt. # realhelpful # totally # thankusomuch;0
information was confusing from # TTC staff. Thank you;0
Thank you # ttc streetcar for closing the backdoor on my hand. If you don't want ppl to go in, maybe check before closing the door.;0
Thank you for making me late for work yet again # ttc;0
Dear TTC bus driver thank you for not letting my 10 years old child on the bus as you were about to depart. # ttc;0
...like when you're going somewhere for the first time and the # TTC's trip planner is down. Thank you, @ TTChelps # TOpolipic.twitter.com/f22KaRRqfL;0
10 minutes until my second class. Missed the first one, thank you # ttc # stillnotgettingthereontime;0
Thank you to the # TTC driver who let me and another passenger into his cab so a man in a wheelchair had space to get onto the streetcar! pic.twitter.com/TXarRaoO7J;0
Thank you for nothing. # TTC is such an embarrassment to # Toronto.;0
Thank you for leaving idle trains in the hot sun so there is max heat in no air cars # TTC;0
Thank you # TTC for creating an underground mobile sauna system. I enjoy sweating and breathing in hot air on my way to and from work.;0
Subway train went out of service and as a result I missed my bus by 3min # ThankYou # TTC now I have yo wait 30min for the next bus # NotHappy;0
Thank you # ttc for closing the doors prematurely because I got stuck behind a slow walker. Ya jerk!;0
Took me more than 90mins from Finch to College. Thank you @ TTCnotices for ruining my # Monday . @ TTChelps @ TorontoComms @ JohnTory # TTC;0
Thank you # TTC bus number 7676 (43 kennedy) for speeding past me as I get to the bus stop with my cane. Good lookin out.;0
"I just accidentally patted a lady on the head on the streetcar and she said thank you"" # ttc""";0
Thank you for the consistently # hot # TTC cars. My sauna costs $141.50/month @ bradTTC;0
Thank you Yonge/University line for having wicked AC the last couple weeks! @ TTChelps @ TTCnotices # TTC # TorontoTransitCommission;0
Thank you Mohamad Alhajabdullah & Son for your guts sticking up to the # TTC! May it be a lesson for the rest of us! # Aodafail;0
Dear Jane Station, thank you for always being a total dissapointment regardless of the day of the week # ttc;0
I just love when the next six buses, supposed to be at about 5 minute intervals, are 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 18 minutes away # TTC # fail;0
the bus is here now, but the driver's gone and left!!!!!!!!!!!!! thanks # ttc i love it when you make me late when I left early for work!!! it's amazing!!!!!!!!!;0
This is why I hate # ttc. Five trains pass with no space. No bench near elevator so I’m seated on the floor waiting. # pwd # Ableism;0
@ metromorning I would love to take the # TTC more often- but If i have an important meeting, I don't trust that I will get there on time. Bikeshare always does...;0
If you’re having a good day, ride a # TTC train and prepare to hate your life.;0
So, an 8 AM subway start isn't really 8 AM. More like whatever time it is now + whenever the train actually shows up... # StClair. # TTC. # Fail.;0
Love it when my 50 minute commute takes 2 hours # ttc;0
Sigh. The TTC is making me so sad this morning. Missed empty streetcar due to post-light stop & now kicked off short-turning subway. Some days I feel like it hates me. # TTC;0
So far it just me or does the # TTC love to screw fixed-income riders?;0
@ TTChelps when are we going to see 24hr subway service on Fridays + weekends like other world class cities? I'd hate to leave a party early bc of the last subway ride. # ttc;0
My thoughts on surrendering to the # TTC. Wonderful headline by @M2Th0mpson. http://ryersonian.ca/opinion-toronto-transit-submission-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-ttc/ …;0
Shoutout to the # TTC for cutting service to where I work and adding more time to my 5 hrs/ day commute. Love paying $146 for shitty service;0
Wow # TTC hate when you decide to make your own bus schedules. Been waiting for 2 buses that have no showed.;0
You have got to # love # TTC bus drivers. Driver on 511 to exhibition place just stopped the bus to grab a # cupofjoe from @ TimHortons;0
The bus just went from 5 mins away to 28. I hate the # TTC.;0
@ TTChelps 30 minutes for 504 is not cool. Forced to take cab. Thanks # ttc # topoli;0
Why does it smell like somebody died on this god forsaken bus?????? I need answers # ttc;0
The commute for Advocate @ mel_graham on # TTC has now been delayed 20 mins, 12 stops & 3 elevators # accessibilityNOWhttps://twitter.com/mel_graham/status/914271805690535936 …;0
No matter what time I ride # TTC route 102 Markham rd the bus is Always rammed riders weren't able to get on at the last stop pic.twitter.com/93f8ahvV34;0
Waiting 40 minutes for a bus that is supposed to come every 3 minutes. # TTC # Stupid;0
3 stop times have passed and still no sign of # TTC 6 Bay bus. This blows;0
When the train operators close the damn doors when there are still people on the platform trying to get on a mostly-empty train. # TTC;0
Sorry, # TTC, I hate this campaign. It makes me feel very unsafe riding on transit. Was that your goal? @ TTChelpspic.twitter.com/X40lgs8wL1;0
What’s up with the Line 1 (Yonge line) SB delays? Wait time for next train at College station is almost 10 minutes?! # TTC # Fail @ TTChelps;0
Made it to Union thanks to # TTC. Had 2 lovely female drivers and 1 male driver who ignored me at bus stop even when i rapped on his door. pic.twitter.com/ZTP3d4EP56;0
can always count on the # TTC to make sure I never get anywhere on time!;0
# TTC T1 car #5093 someone is seriously wrong with the brakes they keep sticking when starting & stopping the most roughest ride ever pic.twitter.com/y9TfOhpVOQ;0
12 minute waits in rush hour are too long. # ttc.;0
It's all fun and games till the # TTC 's unreliability fucks with your money.;0
It takes 65 days for a # TTC elevator to be overhauled - no accessible access to the subway platforms at Kennedy Stn http://www.ttc.ca/Subway/Stations/Kennedy/station.jsp …;0
Not a single 509 streetcar arrived between 8:39AM and 8:52. 8:45 didn't show up. 4 streetcars travelling west though! # TTC # SomeOfUsWorkpic.twitter.com/dFSABJ5ozM;0
Attempting to be positive about @ TTCnotices: it forces me to get exercise by walking instead of riding # dobetter # ttc pic.twitter.com/qRXkbNG3PD;0
"Two days later, back on 5060 and it's still hot... passenger beside me is muttering I hate it here"" # hotcar # topoli # ttc""";0
I hate it when a bus stops and is half empty and the driver doesn’t even make eye contact. Just pure ignores # ttc;0
I waited over 35 mins & others over 40 mins for # ttc bus. Whatever org that @ TTChelps bribed to win transit award is more corrupt than Fifa;0
Great service as always, @ TTChelps. I love when drivers slam the doors in my face & drive away. Awesome way to start a Monday! # TTC;0
That's how it's done on the # TTC block 5 seats with 2 strollers!!! I hate you # TTC;0
How the hell did the # ttc get awarded North America's transit system of the year? Mechanical failure at Bathurst station. # Ilovebeinglate;0
Gotta love when the fucking # TTC decides it's fine to just stop at the drop off spot and NOT THE PICK UP STOP;0
I love how service for the 39/199 buses just goes to complete shit once summer is over. @ TTChelps # TTC;0
Great way to start a Tuesday.. A DELAY AT KENNEDY STATION How # TTC is N.A best transit system 2017 or whatever - Ill never know. # Torontopic.twitter.com/7byzHOxiuG – bei Kennedy Subway/RT Station;0
I hate the # TTC;0
Aaaaand now my day starts off with a subway service suspension, gotta love the # ttc;0
Fuck me, I hate the # TTC;0
I HATE the design of the new streetcars with a passion - # TTC, what were you thinking??;0
"Love that # TTC drivers are allowed to yell fuck you"" at passengers and throw hissy fits kicking things, but if I do it's jail time.""";0
I hate how all the 95 buses go by at the same time, sometimes I'm waiting half hour. Get it together # TTC;0
@ TTChelps @ bradTTC I hate it when the bus comes late and the driver goes somewhere... Why... # ttcfail # TTC;0
This # TTC app was delivered many months late, would love to know how over-budget it as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWE-AK4se3U … # Topoli;0
oh great the streetcars are back! i love when my 30 minute commute takes two hours! today i walked all the way home without seeing one! # ttc;0
I actually hate the # TTC like I saw 3 116 buses come at the same time 20 minutes ago and I have to wait another 10 minutes;0
Yo, I love # Toronto but it's a piece of shit # TTC;0
So the driver tells me to not knock on the door, but if you're not even watching for people waiting for the bus.. # ttchate # ttc;0
I love that the # TTC finds new ways to make itself useless every day. # TTCFail @ TTChelps # ThisTrainIsNowOutOfService;0
"I love when my bus doesn't come when it's supppsed to"", said no one ever. # TTC # TuesdayThoughts""";0
I love sweating like I just ran 10 miles but it's really just the lack of air conditioning in King station. Thanks # TTC!;0
Gods I fucking hate the # TTC more than I hate Game of Thrones spoilers.;0
I love how the new # TTC gates close on you when you're halfway through when exiting the station. Great design.;0
Love these # TTC announcements. Took 3 rounds to hear - when the train was off! Pls @ TTCnotices. Do better.pic.twitter.com/fs7yFSmeht;0
If # ttc is the best transit system, i'd hate to see how horrible others are! What's the point of a schedule if it's not followed? @ TTCwelps;0
Love when it somehow takes 15 minutes to # TTC from St. Clair to Davisville stations. # OneStop # BestTransitInTheWorld;0
# ttc I hate waiting 18 minutes for the next bus when I have to be in 15 minutes at my destination because it takes so long !!!;0
Gotta love an extra half hour on the # subway # ttc;0
How long without subway on weekends due to upgrades? Nightmare to get work due to what? Signal!! Lovely @ TTCnotices # TTC;0
What causes a # ttc signal fail? What's the fix? What's the budget for signal errors and/or daily mechanical issues? # signalproblems;0
Counting three signal delay issues active right now! # TTC;0
I love how this timeline doesn't get communicated anywhere in the system . 40 minute delays? Insanity. @ TTChelps # ttc # Toronto;0
Signal problems pn the subway... why am i not surprised # ttc;0
Stuck on # TTC train for nearly an hour ...not the better way to travel:(;0
The one day I leave early for work and there is a delay on the # TTC 90% of the delays happen during rush hour, never fails!! # LateAgain;0
In conclusion: Eat a dick # TTC. You're holding our city back from being where it needs to be. That was a joke about your consistent delays.;0
In 20 minutes my train went from St. George station to Museum station. # TTC is garbage. @ TTCnotices @ TTChelps @ ttcpanel;0
I agree with you, @ bradTTC and his crew are just trying to create more negative attention between riders etc. # TTC # privatizettc;0
Still on line 1 after 20 mins # ttc;0
The # TTC owes me money for my uber since it's taken an hour just to get from Osgoode to Museum. Unacceptable and unreliable.;0
I'm pretty sure every 20-30 tweets I say this, but # TTC sucks so hard that it truly ruins # Toronto every chance it gets.;0
"Love this idea. The show is called Derailed."" We could do a similar show in Toronto on the # TTC. It could be called ""Delayed"". # Torontohttps://twitter.com/Gothamist/status/895339441119690753 …""";0
29 Duff Bus: where time stands still. @ TTC # ttc # pigs;0
It's insane how someone can throw a brick threw a # TTC streetcar window & it's not covered by @ CP24 @ CTVNews @ globalnewsto. # Toronto;0
Maybe replace # TTC with # UBER;0
Just witnessed the most reckless # TTC driver on a 63 sb @Oss/Dun (bus 1002)... I'm appalled @ TTChelps;0
Waited an hour for the # ttc bus. Feel I shouldn't have to pay the fare. Like a 30 min or free kind of deal;0
The 186 bus driver seen a pregnant lady waving for the bus and drove on by and the bus was not packed # reasonstohatethettc # ttc;0
Continue starving # TTC, good things may happen. # TOpolihttps://twitter.com/NBCNewYork/status/894971511198580737 …;0
It sucks not yo have regular transit service any time you are trying to getto work on the weekends. I love always being late! # TTC;0
When # TTC says the bus is coming in 50 seconds then the bus mysteriously vanishes and the next NEXT bus comes in 8 mins -.- I hate you;0
@ TTCnotices not only has the worst public transport. service in the WORLD but also the worst ad & marketing agency. # hatettc # ttcsucks # ttc;0
"At Kennedy; 43 bus says Due"", then pulls into the station. Then it says 10mins and its been five since and now it's here. Fucking # TTC.""";0
I'm on what is officially the slowest # TTC bus ever.;0
Thanks but really stop the excuses please, your # specialconstables need to be let go just a waste of funding. # TTC @ bradTTC @ TTCchris;0
The 505 west smells like a giant, tepid Cornish pasty # ttc;0
# ttc crappy service # AGAIN streetcarcar service suspended but no need to notify # customers!the driver said it's not her prob tweet it;0
# TTC service on the 511 = pathetic;0
# ttc 46 Martingrove new driver slammed the door shut now slamming the bus around whaattt??!!! @ TTChelps passengers r toast!!;0
So far I’m averaging a min # 30m to commute one way. # rollator # pwdtravels # pwd # pwdcommute # ableism # ttcfail # ttc # ableistTTC;0
. @ TTChelps why is there a 20 min gap in service eastbound 504 on Roncesvalles during rush hour every weekday morning? # ttc;0
Sending love to # TTC bus driver who just splashed me from head to toe-obviously not getting enough love or you wouldn't be so inconsiderate;0
@ TTCnotices Presto not working at Dufferin. # ttc;0
I rarely ride the # TTC anymore because it's so crowded in rush hour (my bike is faster) so of course there are signal delays tonight.;0
Get more and bigger busses for 199A/B.... Waited an hour for a bus... #1 public transit in north America... Pshhh # TTC;0
always forced to stand, and i have a knee problem, and wear a brace. # mad # annoyed # ttc;0
